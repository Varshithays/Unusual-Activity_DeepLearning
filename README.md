# Unusual-Activity_DeepLearning

Developed a system using YOLOv8 model and custom datasets to detect unusual activities in ATM surveillance footage.
Utilized computer vision algorithms for real-time analysis of video frames, identifying anomalies such as unauthorized access or suspicious behavior.
Implemented a notification system to send email alerts upon detection of unusual activity.
